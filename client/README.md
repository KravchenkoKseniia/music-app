## Selecting and Deleting Multiple Tracks

The application allows user to select multiple tracks and delete them in bulk. Below is a step-by-step guide on how this functionality works:

### Steps to Select and Delete Multiple Tracks

1. **Enable Selection Mode**:
   - Click the **"Select tracks"** button. This will enable the selection mode, allowing you to select multiple tracks.

2. **Select Tracks**:
   - In selection mode, click on the track cards you want to delete. Selected tracks will be highlighted.

3. **Delete Selected Tracks**:
   - Once you have selected the desired tracks, click the **"Delete selected"** button. The button will display the number of selected tracks (e.g., `Delete selected (3)`).

4. **Confirmation**:
   - The selected tracks will be deleted, and a success notification will appear if the operation is successful.

### Notes
- If no tracks are selected, the **"Delete selected"** button will be disabled.
- To cancel the selection mode, click the **"Cancel selection"** button. This will clear all selected tracks and exit the selection mode.
- If an error occurs during deletion, an error notification will be displayed.
